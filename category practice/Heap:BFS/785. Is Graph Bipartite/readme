intuition:
1.use an array that marks the state of a node.
2.for all node, if it has been explored, then add into queue to explore
3.use bfs to traversal neighbor node. 
--If neighbor node has not been explored, then give it opposite stauts of current node. 
--If neighbor node has been explored and it's status is same as current one, then return False;
Attention:
1.there might be two or more component of graph, you have to explore all of them.
