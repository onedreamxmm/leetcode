Intuition:
-we can use level order algorithm to traverse each tree's level. In each level, we populate previous node to next node in the queue. 
-In order not to use space, we can keep two pointers. 
Algorithm:
-Two Pointers: One is leftest node of each level. One is cur level node. 
-We go through each level using cur node. While cur node is not null, first we link cur left and cur right, and then we link cur right and cur's next left.
Time Complexity O(N) n is each tree node.
Space Complextiy O(1).
