intuition:
-we can see jump idx is based on previous jump idx and also jump idx's step is based on previous jump idx's step
algorithm:
-use bfs to iterate all result
-use arr to record previous step result
-bfs termination result is max(forbidden, x) + a + b
time complexity
o(v + e)
space complexity O(n)
