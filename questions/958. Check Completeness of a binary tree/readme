Intuition:
If the tree is complete tree, once we encouter none node,  while we do level order traversal of tree. 
We know that the following node which we hasn't done visiting should all be None.
Algorithm:
1. Level order of tree
2. once we encouter None, we stop
3. if there any none node in queue, we return false. Otherwise we return true
