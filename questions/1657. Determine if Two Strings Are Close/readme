intuition:
-operation one means as long as sorted string is same, then two string is close
-operation two means as long as sorted string's character is same and frequency of unique character has been meet in other string, then two string is close
algorithm:
-count each string appearance character frequency, sorted frequency. two string's set should be same.
-count each string character, two string's set should be same.
