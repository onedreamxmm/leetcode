1.split point, mark (start point, -height) and (end point, height).
2.sort point, sweeping point by iterate through point.
3.each x, we get highest y, by putting start x into queue.
4.we elimite height in queue by encountering height is bigger than zero.
5.if there is height difference, then we record in result.
