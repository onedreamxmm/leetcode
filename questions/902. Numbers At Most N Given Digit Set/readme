intuition:
-for length smaller than nums, we can use pow(digit's length, i) to get how many different combination
-for length equal to nums, for each digit, if it starts with this digit, and it smaller than digit at that length, we add pow(digit's length, sl - i - 1) to get
-if digit num equal to s, means we can continue, that's it,
3214 {1,5,3,2}
1xxx 4*4*4 // 5 0 // 3xxx 0 //2xxx 4*4*4 //31xx 
3214 {1,2}
