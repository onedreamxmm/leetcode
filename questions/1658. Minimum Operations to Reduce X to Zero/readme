intuition
-can use dfs or bfs, but it's too slow
-reduce problem: to get mini operation, we want to make middle length which add up to (total sum of array - x) to be as long as possible. 
this observation will lead to divide problem into map and presum solution
algorithm:
- make map to calculate presum.
- if we find map has sum - target, we compare the length and res.
- we get maximum len, return len - maximum len
